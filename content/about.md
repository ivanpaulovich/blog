![Ivan Paulovich](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7133698?s=460&v=4) Hi! I’m **Ivan Paulovich** and I am a .NET developer who recently moved to Stockholm. I have experience with different architecture styles like Event Sourcing, Hexagonal and Clean architectures. Also I have deep knowledge of .NET Framework and its newest frameworks like .NET Core. I am an evangelist of agile development by sharing the good practices of adaptable and evolutionary architectures. I like to design software following DDD and SOLID principles. Please take a look at my open source projects and feel free to reach me in social networks or at [ivan@paulovich.net](mailto:ivan@paulovich.net).

I am willing to expose my thoughts on TDD for a while since I read three books on the subject this year and I am excited with the changes to the way I code on my day to day. I will make it short and if you found it interesting leave a comment and we start a discussion.

What I changed in my Developer Experience (DX)?

I am used to have a pipeline with a large number of "Integration Tests" and UI Tests that verifies the whole system against known issues before deployment. Running this tests take time, usually I can not run them 20 times at the day, which leads to code more as possible then wait for the pipeline to give me the feedback.
